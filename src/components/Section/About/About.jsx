            I graduated from Necmettin Erbakan University Aviation Management.</span>
            Since 2018, I have combined my interest in the computer and software industry with determination.

            After September 2022, I have devoted myself to training and developing on the software industry(especially web development). </span>
            I want to be MERN Stack Developer at first. After that I want to go for  Full-Stack Web Development. I currently live in AydÄ±n, however I can move for work if I have to.

            I love reading mythological stories and books,</span> fun-sounding rhythms and musics, pets, playing (story-based) computer games. Although I am prone to group work, mostly I prefer to have fun with myself in my private and social life.
